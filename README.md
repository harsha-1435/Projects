## 1. Disease Prediction Based on Symptoms Using Ensemble and Hybrid Machine Learning Models

This project aims to predict diseases based on user-reported symptoms using advanced machine learning techniques. By leveraging both hybrid models (Naive Bayes + AdaBoost) and ensemble models (Random Forest + Gradient Boosting), the system enhances accuracy and generalizability in diagnosis. The approach addresses challenges in early disease prediction due to overlapping symptoms and mutations in disease agents. The model achieves up to 92% accuracy through techniques like 10-fold cross-validation and voting classifiers, offering a robust solution for clinical decision support.

## 2. Deep Learning Based Thyroid Tumor Prediction

This project uses deep learning to classify thyroid ultrasound images into benign, malignant, or normal categories. The system employs ResNet-101 for feature extraction and a custom 4-layer CNN to enhance classification accuracy. Through rigorous cross-validation and data augmentation, the model achieves up to 93% accuracy. This AI-driven approach assists doctors in early and accurate diagnosis of thyroid conditions, aiming to reduce the need for invasive procedures and improve patient outcomes.

## 3. LLM-Driven Approach to Virtual AI-Based Healthcare Assistance

This project introduces a virtual healthcare assistant that provides medical information and symptom-based disease predictions through conversational AI. It integrates a fine-tuned RoBERTa model for dialogue and ensemble ML models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) for prediction. Hosted using Flask and powered by a curated medical dataset, the assistant reduces healthcare workload by delivering accessible, accurate, and privacy-conscious medical support via a web application.

## 4. Intelligent Textbook Assistance System

This system enhances learning by transforming static textbooks into interactive, AI-powered study companions. Leveraging the LLaMA 2 language model and sentence transformers, it answers user queries based on uploaded textbook PDFs. The backend uses FAISS vector stores for fast retrieval and LangChain for orchestration. Designed for personalized education, the system provides detailed explanations, examples, and real-time assistance, supporting self-directed learning and better content retention.

## 5. Image to Text and Text to Speech Converter

This accessibility-focused project extracts text from images using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and converts it into natural-sounding speech using Glow TTS, a neural text-to-speech model. It supports multilingual output and is optimized for low latency and high fidelity. Designed for visually impaired users and those preferring auditory formats, the system contributes significantly to inclusive technology by offering an efficient and user-friendly way to access visual content.
